## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

For this project, I used HTML and CSS to construct and style a simple attractive calculator. After adding the event listeners for the JavaScript, I decided that keystrokes also needed to be added to the event listeners in order to make the calculator behave more realistically.

## Optimizations

I would really like to add sounds to mimic the clicking of keys, I think it would help with the user experience. Also, there is one bug in my calculator - if you haven't found it already... it currently accepts multiple decimals. I would like to add a couple of functions that control the input more thoroughly.

## Lessons Learned:

Adding the keystokes to this project was a major contribution for me, especially at the time. In a world of click event listeners, adding the keyboard input was like dipping back into the dark ages. I'm proud of the way I styled the colors and edges of this project with CSS. They are very smooth and easy on the eyes.
